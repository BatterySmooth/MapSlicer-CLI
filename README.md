# MapSlicer-CLI Documentation

MapSlicer-CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to slice the top off your Timberborn map so that you can edit it and then recombine it. This documentation provides instructions on how to install and use MapSlicer-CLI.

## Installation

To install MapSlicer-CLI, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Create a folder wherever you would like to install MapSlicer-CLI.
3. Right-click on the folder and select "Open terminal" to open a command-line interface.
4. Type `npm i mapslicer-cli` and press Enter

This will install MapSlicer-CLI as a global package on your system.

## Initial Setup

Once MapSlicer-CLI is installed, you can start the initial setup by typing `npx mapslicer-cli` into the same terminal window we used in the installation.

This will launch MapSlicer-CLI and prompt you to provide some configuration details.

1. The first prompt will ask you to provide the path to the Timberborn folder, located in your documents folder.

>You can leave this blank to accept the default path of `/Documents/Timberborn/`. If, for example, you have OneDrive, you would type `/OneDrive/Documents/Timberborn/`.
>
>>### Please Note
>>
>>The `/` at the start and end of the path are critical for setting up the configuration, so make sure to include them if you provide a custom path.

2. The second prompt will ask for the Timberborn map folder's path. You can almost always leave this blank to accept the default path of `Maps/`.

MapSlicer-CLI will then perform some setup tasks, including setting up the environment, and provide you with two shortcuts to launch and update MapSlicer-CLI.
